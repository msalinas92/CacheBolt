# ⚡️ CacheBolt

> A blazing-fast reverse proxy with intelligent caching and multi-backend object storage support.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

**CacheBolt** is a high-performance reverse proxy designed to cache and serve responses with minimal latency. It intelligently stores responses in memory and synchronizes them with persistent object storage backends.

This tool is ideal for accelerating APIs, file delivery, and improving reliability under high load.

CacheBolt reads its configuration from a YAML file. By default, it expects a file named:

```bash
./config.yaml
```

You can override this path via CLI:

```bash
./cachebolt --config ./path/to/custom.yaml
```

### ✨ Features

- 🔁 Reverse HTTP proxy powered by [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
- 🚀 Fast, concurrent in-memory caching with LRU eviction
- ☁️ Multi-cloud object store support:
  - 🟢 Amazon S3
  - 🔵 Google Cloud Storage
  - 🔶 Azure Blob Storage
  - 💽 Local filesystem
- 📉 Memory-based cache eviction (threshold-configurable)
- ⏱️ Latency-based failover policies (regex route rules)
- 🧠 Smart fallback if upstreams are slow or unavailable

## 🔧 Configuration

The config is written in YAML. Example:

```yaml
app_id: my-service

max_concurrent_requests: 200
downstream_base_url: http://localhost:4000
downstream_timeout_secs: 5

storage_backend: s3  # options: gcs, s3, azure, local
gcs_bucket: cachebolt
s3_bucket: my-cachebolt-bucket
azure_container: cachebolt-container

memory_eviction:
  threshold_percent: 90

latency_failover:
  default_max_latency_ms: 300
  path_rules:
    - pattern: "^/api/v1/products/.*"
      max_latency_ms: 150
    - pattern: "^/auth/.*"
      max_latency_ms: 100
```

## 🔐 Cloud Storage Authentication

Depending on the storage backend, you'll need to configure credentials via environment variables:

### Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Must be authenticated using Application Default Credentials (ADC), which you can set via:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
```

### Amazon S3
- Required environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1  # or your specific region
```

### Azure Blob Storage
- Required environment variables:
```bash
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=your_account_name
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
```

### Local Filesystem
- No additional credentials required. Cache files will be saved locally.
