/// Background memory eviction task for CacheBolt based on system memory fluctuations

use crate::memory::memory::{MEMORY_CACHE, get_memory_usage_kib, maybe_evict_if_needed};

/// Launches a continuous background task to monitor system memory usage and
/// perform cache eviction dynamically under pressure.
///
/// The logic operates as follows:
/// - Every second, it reads the current memory usage of the system.
/// - If the current usage (in percent) exceeds the last observed usage,
///   it triggers a check to evict entries from the in-memory LRU cache.
/// - This complements the on-write eviction and adds adaptive behavior under load.
///
/// This mechanism ensures the cache remains efficient and avoids OOM conditions,
/// especially under high traffic or memory contention scenarios.
